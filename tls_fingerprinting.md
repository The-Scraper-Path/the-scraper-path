## Possible workarounds

### Cipher stunting

### Headless browser
[...]


### TLS spoofing

There are some recently created libraries that allow to create "realistic" TLS fingerprints. 

* [uTLS](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls) in go
* [myTLS](https://github.com/zedd3v/mytls) in JavaScript/nodejs
* [Cycle TLS](https://github.com/Danny-Dasilva/CycleTLS) in JavaScript/nodejs
