There are some companies offering Antibot solutions to detect and ban bots.

Some of them are:
* Akamai
* Couldfare
* Distil
* Imperva/incapsula
* PermiterX
* DataDome
* Kasada

I will use this section to explain how they work, general aspects, how to determine if there's an antibot solution in place, etc.
