# The Scraper Path

## About

Hey!

I’m Marc and I’ve been working on the scraping world for some years. If there’s something I realized during this time, apart from how interesting and challenging this world is, is that becoming good at it requires a set of very specific skills, and it seems that there’s a general lack of good resources explaining those different topics.

On this website I would like to freely share with you all my knowledge to build what I called “The Scraper Path”, a guide to teach people from around the world how to be able to access all the data across the internet, providing access to it and helping them to build their incredible projects.


Proxies, Antibots, HTTP protocol, data extraction… all you will need to become a successful Scraper will be here.


Take a look to the content I expect to write about :) 


## Content

### Extracting Data
* [HTML, CSS selectors, XPATH, JSON, jmespath, regex and other techniques](data_extraction.md)


### Accessing Data

* JavaScript deobfuscation
* Android reverse engineering
  * MITM proxies: Mitmproxy, Burpsuite
  * Certificate Pinning
  * Frida
  * Java deobfuscation (JADX, smali...)
* Cryptography


### Avoid Detection
* [IP Banning: Proxies](proxy.md)
* Captchas
* Fingerprinting:
  * Browser fingerprinting
  * [TLS Fingerprinting](tls_fingerprinting.md)
* Antibots: Akamai, Couldfare, distil, imperva/incapsula, permiterX, DataDome, Kasada...
* [Akamai Antibot in depth](akamai.md)


### Other tools
* Headless browsers: Selenium, Puppeteer, Playwright


### More about scraping
