# The Scraper Path

## About

Hey!

I’m Marc and I’ve been working on the scraping world for some years. If there’s something I realized during this time, apart from how interesting and challenging this world is, is that becoming good at it requires a set of very specific skills, and it seems that there’s a general lack of good resources explaining those different topics.

On this repository I would like to freely share with you all my knowledge to build what I called “The Scraper Path”, a guide to teach people from around the world how to be able to access all the data across the internet, providing access to it and helping them to build their incredible projects.


Proxies, Antibots, HTTP protocol, data extraction… all you will need to become a successful Scraper will be here.


Take a look at the content I expect to write about :) 


## Content

### Extracting Data
* [HTML, CSS selectors, XPATH, JSON, jmespath, regex and other techniques](data_extraction.md) ✅


### Accessing Data
* HTTP protocol, headers, cookies, etc.
* JavaScript deobfuscation
* Android reverse engineering
  * MITM proxies: Mitmproxy, Charles Proxy, Burpsuite
  * Certificate Pinning
  * Java deobfuscation (JADX, smali...)
  * Code injection using Frida
* Cryptography


### Avoid Detection
* [IP Banning: Proxies](proxy.md) ✅
* Captchas
* Fingerprinting:
  * [Browser fingerprinting](browser_fingerprinting.md) 🚧
  * [TLS Fingerprinting](tls_fingerprinting.md) 🚧
* [Antibots and how they work](antibots.md) 🚧
* [Akamai Antibot in depth](akamai.md) ✅


### Other tools
* [Headless browsers](headless_browsers.md) 🚧


### Processing and saving data
* Data normalization and QA
* Storing data


### More about scraping
* Legal aspects and implications
* Who in the tech industry is using scraping and how?
* Future of the scraping: ML, Antibots...


And please! Any suggestion is welcomed! Don't hesitate to comment on the issues section.
